Bike Sales Dashboard
This repository contains an Excel dashboard that visualizes various aspects of bike sales data, focusing on customer demographics and purchasing behavior. The dashboard is designed to provide insights into the factors influencing bike purchases and to help identify potential market trends.

Dashboard Overview
The dashboard consists of three key visualizations:

Average Income by Gender and Purchase Status:
This chart displays the average income of male and female customers who have and have not purchased bikes. It helps to identify income patterns among different genders and their correlation with bike purchases.

Commute Distance in Miles and Purchase Status:
This chart shows the distribution of commute distances (in miles) for customers who have purchased bikes and those who haven't. It provides insights into whether commute distance plays a role in the decision to purchase a bike.

Age Brackets and Purchase Status:
This chart categorizes customers into various age brackets and compares the distribution of those who have purchased bikes against those who haven't. It helps to understand the age groups more likely to purchase bikes.
